# Network Design Final Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing and simulating the network infrastructure for the Herman Ottó Institute. It includes the network simulation created using Cisco Packet Tracer, documentation, and a detailed server environment. The goal is to provide a secure, efficient network that meets the client's specifications.

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Version X.X or higher)
- Operating System: Windows/Linux
- Basic knowledge of VLANs, routing protocols (OSPF, HSRP), and server configuration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nuubshybot/Network-Design-Final-Project.git
    ```
2. Open the Cisco Packet Tracer file (`HOI.pkt`) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Review the network topology and configuration as shown in the documentation.

## Usage
- **Network Topology**: The network consists of two sites, interconnected with VLANs, static and dynamic routing (OSPF), and WAN technologies. The simulation includes tests for high availability using HSRP and EtherChannel. Wireless networks are also configured.

- **Server Environment**: Configurations include DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, and backup servers. The setup ensures redundancy and efficient IP address allocation.

## Files
- **Main Documentation** (`Fő_Dokummentáció.pdf`): Contains detailed network and server design, IP addressing, and protocol configurations.
- **Testing Documentation** (`Tesztelesi_dokumentacio.pdf`): Describes the validation tests for VLANs, OSPF, NAT, and firewall configurations.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation** (`HOI.pkt`): The full network simulation file.
